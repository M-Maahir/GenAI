**Lists vs Tuples in Python**
=====================================

In Python, `lists` and `tuples` are two fundamental data structures that can store multiple values. While they share some similarities, there are key differences between them.

**Lists**
---------

*   **Mutable**: Lists are mutable, meaning their contents can be modified after creation.
*   **Ordered**: Lists maintain the order in which elements were added.
*   **Dynamic size**: Lists can grow or shrink dynamically as elements are added or removed.

Example:
```python
# Create a list
my_list = [1, 2, 3]

# Append an element
my_list.append(4)
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Remove an element
my_list.remove(2)
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 3, 4]
```

### List Comprehensions

List comprehensions are a concise way to create lists in Python. They consist of brackets containing an expression followed by a `for` clause, then zero or more `for` or `if` clauses.

```python
# Create a list of squares using a for loop
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squares = []
for num in numbers:
    squares.append(num ** 2)

# Use a list comprehension to create the same list
squares = [num ** 2 for num in numbers]

print(squares)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

In this example, we use a list comprehension to create a new list by iterating over an existing list and applying a transformation to each element. The resulting list is equivalent to the one created using a traditional for loop.

### Benefits of List Comprehensions

1.  **Concise Code**: List comprehensions are often more concise than traditional for loops, making them easier to read and write.
2.  **Faster Execution**: Since list comprehensions avoid the overhead of function calls and loop variables, they can be faster than equivalent code using traditional for loops.
3.  **Improved Readability**: By expressing complex operations in a single line, list comprehensions can improve code readability and make it easier to understand.

Here is an example of how you might use a list comprehension to create a new list that contains only the even numbers from a given list:

```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6]
```

In this example, we use a list comprehension to create a new list `even_numbers` that contains only the elements from the original list `numbers` where the remainder of dividing by 2 is 0.
