      "### map() Function in Python\n",
      "\n",
      "The `map()` function in Python is a built-in function that applies a given function to each item of an iterable (such as a list, tuple, or string) and returns a map object.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Syntax:**\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "map(function, iterables)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "*   `function` is the function to be applied to each item of the iterable.\n",
      "*   `iterables` is the sequence (like a list, tuple, etc.) whose elements will be used with `function`.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example Usage:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's consider we have a list of numbers `[1, 2, 3]`, and we want to double every number.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def multiply_by_two(num):\n",
      "    return num * 2\n",
      "\n",
      "numbers = [1, 2, 3]\n",
      "double_numbers = list(map(multiply_by_two, numbers))\n",
      "\n",
      "print(double_numbers) # Output: [2, 4, 6]\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Return Value:\n",
      "\n",
      "The `map()` function returns a map object, which is an iterator. This means it does not store all values in memory at once. If we want to access the returned map like a list or set of elements, we should explicitly call `list(map(...))`, as shown above.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Notes:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   We cannot unpack `iterables` and get an iterabkle value. Only one iterable must be provided at any time. Use functions in python are passed last as a tuple argument to support variable length tuples like list etc\n",
      "\n",
      "However upon using, its clear to you if there is possibility that may arise so, always review your usage and the error message for what possible reason that could happen to make it better than expected.\n",
      "Here, when dealing with function that returns any output. I think that returning map might raise many confusion in your development life\n",
