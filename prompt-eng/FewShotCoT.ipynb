    "# Chain-of-Thought Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances complex reasoning by encouraging the model to break down problems into intermediate reasoning steps. When combined with few-shot prompting, it can significantly improve performance on tasks that require multi-step reasoning before arriving at a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Automatic Chain-of-Thought (Auto-CoT)\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, using CoT prompting with demonstrations involves manually crafting diverse and effective examples. This manual effort is time-consuming and can lead to less-than-optimal results. To address this, Zhang et al. (2022) introduced Auto-CoT, an automated approach that minimizes manual involvement. Their method uses the prompt “Let’s think step by step” to generate reasoning chains automatically for demonstrations. However, this automatic process is not immune to errors. To reduce the impact of such mistakes, the approach emphasizes the importance of diverse demonstrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Auto-CoT operates in two main stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Question Clustering:** Questions from the dataset are grouped into clusters based on similarity or relevance.\n",
    "2. **Demonstration Sampling:** A representative question from each cluster is selected, and its reasoning chain is generated using Zero-Shot-CoT guided by simple heuristics.\n",

      "A correct explanation of the use of the `map()` function in Python.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a breakdown of the code:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   The `map()` function applies a given function to each item of an iterable (in this case, the list `my_list`).\n",
      "*   In the `map()` call, `'greeting'.format(name=name)` is a string formatting expression that replaces `'name'` with the actual name passed as an argument (`name`).\n",
      "*   The resulting string is the greeting message with the person's name included.\n",
      "*   The `.join(my_list)` part is used to concatenate all elements of `my_list` into a single string, separated by spaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's how it can be used:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def greet(name):\n",
      "    \"\"\"Return a personalized greeting.\"\"\"\n",
      "    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "greeting = \" \".join(greet(\"John\") for _ in range(5))\n",
      "print(greeting)  # Output: Hello John!\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This code defines a `greet` function that takes a name as input and returns a greeting. The expression `\" \".join(greet(\"John\") for _ in range(5))` creates a string with five repetitions of the greeting, which is then printed to the console. \n",
      "\n",
      "You can generalize this pattern into a function like so:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def repeat_greeting(name, repetition):\n",
      "    \"\"\"\n",

      "        repetition (int): The number of times the name should be repeated.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Returns:\n",
      "        str: A string containing the repeated name.\n",
      "    \"\"\"\n",

      "    if not isinstance(name, str) or not isinstance(repetition_count, int):\n",
      "        raise ValueError(\"Invalid input\")\n",
      "\n",
      "    # If the repetition count is 0 or less, we just return an empty string. This makes sense\n",
      "    # because there's nothing to repeat anyway!\n",
