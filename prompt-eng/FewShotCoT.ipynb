    "# Chain-of-Thought Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances complex reasoning by encouraging the model to break down problems into intermediate reasoning steps. When combined with few-shot prompting, it can significantly improve performance on tasks that require multi-step reasoning before arriving at a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Automatic Chain-of-Thought (Auto-CoT)\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, using CoT prompting with demonstrations involves manually crafting diverse and effective examples. This manual effort is time-consuming and can lead to less-than-optimal results. To address this, Zhang et al. (2022) introduced Auto-CoT, an automated approach that minimizes manual involvement. Their method uses the prompt “Let’s think step by step” to generate reasoning chains automatically for demonstrations. However, this automatic process is not immune to errors. To reduce the impact of such mistakes, the approach emphasizes the importance of diverse demonstrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Auto-CoT operates in two main stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Question Clustering:** Questions from the dataset are grouped into clusters based on similarity or relevance.\n",
    "2. **Demonstration Sampling:** A representative question from each cluster is selected, and its reasoning chain is generated using Zero-Shot-CoT guided by simple heuristics.\n",

      "A correct explanation of the use of the `map()` function in Python.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a breakdown of the code:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   The `map()` function applies a given function to each item of an iterable (in this case, the list `my_list`).\n",
      "*   In the `map()` call, `'greeting'.format(name=name)` is a string formatting expression that replaces `'name'` with the actual name passed as an argument (`name`).\n",
      "*   The resulting string is the greeting message with the person's name included.\n",
      "*   The `.join(my_list)` part is used to concatenate all elements of `my_list` into a single string, separated by spaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's how it can be used:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def greet(name):\n",
      "    \"\"\"Return a personalized greeting.\"\"\"\n",
      "    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",

      "print(greeting)  # Output: Hello John!\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This code defines a `greet` function that takes a name as input and returns a greeting. The expression `\" \".join(greet(\"John\") for _ in range(5))` creates a string with five repetitions of the greeting, which is then printed to the console. \n",
      "\n",
      "You can generalize this pattern into a function like so:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def repeat_greeting(name, repetition):\n",
      "    \"\"\"\n",

      "#### Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "TensorFlow's Keras API provides a simple and intuitive way to create word embeddings using the Word2Vec algorithm.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Retrieving Relevant Documentation\n",
      "\n",
      "1. To learn more about Word2Vec in TensorFlow, we can refer to the official TensorFlow documentation: https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/api_docs/python.keras.layers.Embedding\n",
      "2. Specifically, the `Embedding` layer can be used for word embeddings using Word2Vec.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Understanding the Code\n",
      "\n",
      "The `Embedding` layer takes two main arguments:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   `input_dim`: The number of input features (i.e., the vocabulary size).\n",
      "*   `output_dim`: The dimensionality of the embedded space.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Word2Vec, each word is mapped to a dense vector in a high-dimensional space. The `Embedding` layer can be used to create this mapping.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Example Usage\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to use the `Embedding` layer for word embeddings using TensorFlow and Keras:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import tensorflow as tf\n",
      "from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, Input, Flatten, Dense\n",
      "\n",
      "# Define input shape\n",
      "input_shape = (20,)\n",
      "\n",
      "# Create embedding layer with Word2Vec configuration\n",
      "embedding_layer = Embedding(input_dim=10000, output_dim=128, input_length=None,\n",
      "                           weights=[None], trainable=True)\n",
      "\n",
      "# Create input tensor with 10 words and 5 indices for each word\n",
      "x = Input(shape=input_shape)\n",
      "inputs = embedding_layer(x)\n",
      "\n",
      "# Convert the embedded inputs to a Dense layer's input shape (1D tensor)\n",
      "outputs = Flatten()(inputs)\n",
      "\n",
      "# Print the output shape of the dense layer to verify that it is correct.\n",

      "model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam')\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, we define an embedding layer with a Word2Vec configuration and use it as input to a dense layer. The output shape of the dense layer should match the expected shape for our use case.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Note:** To train the `Embedding` layer, you need to provide the weights (i.e., pre-trained word embeddings) or train them during training using the `trainable=True` argument.\n",

      "### Syntactical Errors in Python\n",
      "\n",
      "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for various applications. Like any other programming language, it has its own set of syntax rules and conventions. Understanding these rules can help you write cleaner, more efficient, and effective code.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some common syntactical errors to watch out for:\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 1. Indentation Errors\n",
      "\n",
      "In Python, indentation (spaces or tabs) is used to denote block-level structure. Incorrect indentation can cause a SyntaxError.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Example of an indentation error\n",
      "if True:\n",
      " print('True')\n",
      "   # Incorrect indentation here\n",
      "else:\n",
      " print('False')\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. Missing or Extra Colon\n",
      "\n",
      "In Python, a colon (:) is used to indicate the start of a block-level statement, such as a loop or if-else statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Example of an extra colon error\n",
      "if True\n",
      "print('True') # Extra colon here\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3. Missing Parentheses\n",
      "\n",
      "Python uses parentheses () to group expressions and denote function calls.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Example of a missing parentheses error\n",
      "def greet(name)\n",
      "   print(f'Hello, {name}!')\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 4. Typos in Keywords\n",
      "\n",
      "Python keywords are case-sensitive and must be spelled correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Example of a typo error\n",
      "if true:\n",
      "   print('True')\n",
      "else:\n",
      "   print('False') # Typo here: 'true' instead of 'True'\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Correcting Syntactical Errors\n",
      "\n",
      "To correct syntactical errors, you can use various tools and resources available in Python development environments. Some common tools include:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   PEP 8: The official style guide for Python code.\n",
      "*   PyLint: A linter that checks your code against PEP 8 rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's an example of using PyLint to check your code:\n",
      "\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "# Install PyLint if not already installed\n",
      "pip install pylint\n",
      "\n",
      "# Check your code using PyLint\n",
      "pylint your_file.py\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "Syntactical errors in Python can be caused by incorrect indentation, missing or extra colons, missing parentheses, and typos in keywords. By understanding these rules and conventions, you can write cleaner and more efficient code. Using tools like PEP 8 and PyLint can help you catch and correct these errors before running your code.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Example Code\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def greet(name):\n",
      "    \"\"\"Prints a personalized greeting message.\"\"\"\n",
      "    print(f'Hello, {name}!')\n",
      "\n",
      "# Call the function with a name argument\n",
      "greet('John Doe')\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This example defines a simple `greet` function that takes a `name` argument and prints a personalized greeting message. The function is called with the string `'John Doe'` as an argument.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope this helps you identify and correct syntactical errors in your Python code! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.\n",
