      "Here's an example of how you can create a list and a tuple:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Creating a list\n",
      "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",

      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "As you can see, lists are defined with square brackets `[]`, while tuples are defined with parentheses `()`. This also reflects their mutability:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Modifying a list\n",
      "my_list[0] = 'a'\n",
      "print(my_list)  # Output: ['a', 2, 3]\n",

      "# Trying to modify a tuple (will raise an error)\n",
