      "**Map() Function in Python**\n",
      "==========================\n",
      "\n",
      "The `map()` function is a built-in Python function that applies a given function to each item of an iterable (such as a list, tuple, or string) and returns a new list with the results.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Syntax\n",
      "```python\n",
      "map(function, iterables)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "*   `function`: The function to be applied to each item.\n",
      "*   `iterables`: The items to which the function will be applied.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Example Usage\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def square(num):\n",
      "    return num * num\n",
      "\n",
      "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
      "squares = map(square, numbers)\n",
      "print(list(squares))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, the `square()` function is applied to each item in the `numbers` list using `map()`. The results are then converted to a list and printed.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Filtering with `map()`\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def is_even(num):\n",
      "    return num % 2 == 0\n",
      "\n",
      "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
      "even_numbers = map(is_even, numbers)\n",
      "print(list(even_numbers))  # Output: <map object at 0x7f939bfece80>\n",
      "# Note that map returns a map object in this case\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "The `is_even()` function checks whether a number is even by checking if the remainder when divided by 2 is 0. This example demonstrates how to use `map()` to filter items in an iterable based on a condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Real-world Application\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def process_string(s):\n",
      "    s = s.lower()\n",
      "    return ''.join([c if c.isalnum() else ' ' for c in s])\n",
      "\n",
      "text = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
      "formatted_text = map(process_string, [text])\n",
      "print(' '.join(map(str, formatted_text)))  # Output: hello world\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This example applies the `process_string()` function to a string, replacing any non-alphanumeric characters with spaces and then joins these results together into a new string. The output shows how this is done using a real-world application of map filtering.\n",
      "\n",
      "These examples highlight key points on usage in programming for effectively employing 'map' to create useful filters on various types of data in many different scenarios!\n",
