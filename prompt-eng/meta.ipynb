    "# Meta Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Meta prompting is an advanced technique in prompt engineering that emphasizes the structural and syntactical organization of tasks and problems rather than focusing on their specific content. The objective is to create a more abstract, form-driven way of engaging with large language models (LLMs), highlighting patterns and structure over traditional content-focused methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "As outlined by [Zhang et al. (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11482), the defining features of meta prompting include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Structure-Oriented: Prioritizes the organization and pattern of problems and solutions instead of specific content.\n",
    "* Syntax-Guided: Leverages syntax as a template to shape the expected responses or solutions.\n",
    "* Abstract Frameworks: Uses abstract examples as blueprints, demonstrating the structure of tasks without relying on concrete details.\n",
    "* Domain Versatility: Can be applied across multiple fields, offering structured solutions to diverse problem types.\n",
    "* Categorical Approach: Draws on type theory to organize and categorize components logically, enhancing prompt coherence and precision."

      "=====================================\n",
      "\n",
      "The `map()` function in Python is a built-in function that applies a given function to each item of an iterable (such as a list, tuple, or string) and returns a map object.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Definition and Syntax\n",
      "```python\n",
      "map(function, iterables)\n",
      "```\n",
      "*   `function`: The function to be applied to each item in the `iterables`.\n",
      "*   `iterables`: The items that will be mapped through the given `function`.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can find more information about the `map()` function on the official Python documentation page:\n",
      "\n",
      "[Python Documentation - map() Function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Concise Explanation\n",
      "The purpose of the `map()` function is to take a function and an iterable, and return a new iterable that applies the function to each item in the original iterable.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Example Usage\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a simple example that uses the `map()` function with the square function (`lambda x: x ** 2`) to calculate the squares of numbers:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
      "\n",
      "def square(x):\n",
      "    return lambda y: y ** 2\n",
      "\n",
      "squares = list(map(square, numbers))\n",

      "\n",
      "[ Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25] ]\n",
      "\n",
      "To directly use this square example using the more standard syntax without needing a lambda function:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import math\n",
      "\n",
      "def get_squares():\n",
      "    return map(lambda x : math.pow(x ,2), [1 , 2 ,3 ,4, 5])\n",
      "square_value_list = list( get_squares() )\n",

      "================================\n",
      "\n",
      "**Definition and Syntax**\n",
      "------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "In Python, strings can be reversed using slicing with a step of -1.\n",
      "\n",
      " Official Documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#strings\n",
      "\n",
      " **Syntax**: `s[::-1]`\n",
      "\n",
      "**Concise Explanation**\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "The `s[::-1]` syntax tells Python to start at the end of the string and move backwards to the beginning, stepping by 1 character each time.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example Usage**\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def reverse_string(s):\n",
      "    return s[::-1]\n",
      "\n",
      "# Test the function\n",
      "original_string = \"hello\"\n",
      "reversed_string = reverse_string(original_string)\n",
      "print(reversed_string)  # Output: \"olleh\"\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, we define a function `reverse_string` that takes a string as input and returns the reversed string using slicing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, you can use the built-in `reversed()` function in combination with the `join()` method:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def reverse_string(s):\n",
      "    return \"\".join(reversed(s))\n",
      "\n",
      "# Test the function\n",
      "original_string = \"hello\"\n",
      "reversed_string = reverse_string(original_string)\n",
      "print(reversed_string)  # Output: \"olleh\"\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach reverses the characters in the string and then joins them back together into a single string.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Additional Tips**\n",
      "\n",
      "* You can also use `reversed()` alone with a string, but you need to join the result of the reversed iterator back into a string using the `join()` method or concatenate it manually.\n",
      "* For more complex strings or operations, consider using higher-level libraries or functions, such as those in the `itertools` module.\n",
