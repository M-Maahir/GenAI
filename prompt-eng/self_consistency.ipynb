    "# Self Consistency Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the more advanced techniques in prompt engineering is self-consistency, introduced by `Wang et al. (2022)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "This method seeks to improve upon the traditional greedy decoding typically used in chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. \n",
    "\n",
    "The core concept involves sampling multiple diverse reasoning paths through few-shot CoT and leveraging these variations to determine the most consistent answer. The technique  enhances the effectiveness of CoT prompting, particularly for tasks requiring arithmetic and commonsense reasoning.\n",

      "**Using the `map()` Function in Python**\n",
      "=====================================\n",
      "\n",
      "The `map()` function in Python applies a given function to each item of an iterable (such as a list, tuple, or string) and returns a new iterable with the results.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Syntax**\n",
      "```python\n",
      "map(function, iterable)\n",
      "```\n",
      "**Example Use Case: Squaring Numbers**\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose we have a list of numbers and want to square each number.\n",
      "```python\n",
      "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
      "\n",
      "squared_numbers = map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers)\n",
      "\n",
      "print(list(squared_numbers))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, we use the `map()` function to apply a lambda function (an anonymous function) to each element in the `numbers` list. The lambda function takes an input `x` and returns its square (`x**2`). The resulting values are collected into a new list.\n",
      "\n",
      "### How it works\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Function definition**: We define a lambda function that takes one argument, `x`, and returns its square.\n",
      "2.  **Iteration**: We iterate over the range of numbers from 0 to 9 (inclusive) using a for loop.\n",
      "3.  **Calculation**: Inside the loop, we calculate the square of each number using the formula `result = num * num`.\n",
      "4.  **Printing**: Finally, we print the result.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the complete code:\n",

      "# Define a function to calculate squares\n",

      "**Reversing a String in Python**\n",
      "================================\n",
      "\n",
      "In Python, you can reverse a string using slicing or the `reversed()` function. Here's how:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Method 1: Using Slicing\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def reverse_string(s):\n",
      "    return s[::-1]\n",
      "\n",
      "# Example usage:\n",
      "original_string = \"hello\"\n",
      "reversed_string = reverse_string(original_string)\n",
      "print(reversed_string)  # Output: \"olleh\"\n",
      "```\n",
      "In this method, `s[::-1]` is using Python's slice notation to extract the characters of the string in reverse order.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Using Built-in Functions\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, you can use the built-in `reversed()` function and the `join()` method to achieve the same result:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def reverse_string(s):\n",
      "    return ''.join(reversed(s))\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach is more explicit and easier to understand for those unfamiliar with slice notation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Using Recursion\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way to implement string reversal is using recursion:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def reverse_string_recursive(s):\n",
      "    if len(s) <= 1:\n",
      "        return s\n",
      "    else:\n",
      "        return reverse_string_recursive(s[1:]) + s[0]\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "However, please note that this recursive approach may cause a stack overflow for large input strings due to the repeated function calls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's an example of how you can use these functions in Python:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def main():\n",
      "    # Test with small string\n",
      "    str = \"Hello\"\n",
      "    print(f\"Original String: {str}\")\n",
      "    print(\"Reversed String:\", reverse_string(str))\n",
      "    \n",
      "    # Test with large string\n",
      "    str_large = \"A\"*1000\n",
      "    print(\"\\nOriginal Large String:\")\n",
      "    for i in range(10):\n",
      "        print(str_large[i*100: (i+1)*100])\n",
      "    print(\"Reversed Large String:\", reverse_string(str_large))\n",
      "\n",
      "def reverse(s):\n",
      "    return s[::-1]\n",
      "\n",
